## Project Steps
### Step 1: Data Preparation and Exploration
- Describe the dataset: Understand the structure, columns, and data types.
- Clean the data: Check for invalid records, missing values, duplicated records, and outliers.
- Handle Missing Values: Detect missing values and apply appropriate imputation techniques.
- Detect outliers: Identify outliers and decide whether to remove or transform them.
### Step 2: Data Visualization
- Create visualizations such as scatter plots, line plots, and barplots to explore relationships between variables.
- plotting time series data to analyzetrends and seasonality.
- Using heatmaps or correlation matrices to understand the correlation between different features.
- Utilizing seaborn, matplotlib, or other libraries for generating informative and visually appealing plots.
### Step 3: Feature Engineering
- Generating new features from existing ones to improve model performance.
- Handling categorical variales through techniques like label encoding and one-hot encoding.
- Scaling or normalizing numerical features to ensure uniformity in their ranges.
- Incorporating domain knowledge to create meaningful features that capture important aspects of the data.
### Step 4: Model Building
- Selecting appropriate machine learning algorithms such as Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, AdaBoost, and XGBoost Regression for predicting bike rental demand.
- Splitting the dataset into training and testing set for model evaluation.
- Training various models using the training data and evaluating their performance using metrics like MSE, RMSE, MAE or R-squared.
- Fine-Tuning model parameters to optimize performance.
### Step 5: Hyperparameter Tuning
- Conducting hyperparameter tuning for Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, AdaBoost, and XGBoost Regression using techniques like grid search or random search to find the best combination of model parameters.
- Evaluating model performance with different hyperparameter values using cross-validation techniques.
- Balancing model complexity and performance to prevent overfitting or underfitting.
### Step 6: Model Evaluation
- Evaluation metrics for regression models: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), R-squared (R^2), etc.
- Compare the performance of different models to select the best one.
### Step 7: Model Deployment
- Once the best model is selected, deploy it in a production environment where it can be used to make predictions.
- Monitor the performance of the deployed model over time and update it as needed.
